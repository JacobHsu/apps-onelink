#### Test 2
- **Test ID:** TC004
- **Test Name:** Social Links Management - Invalid URL Input Handling
- **Test Code:** [TC004_Social_Links_Management___Invalid_URL_Input_Handling.py](./TC004_Social_Links_Management___Invalid_URL_Input_Handling.py)
- **Test Error:** Tested invalid or malformed social media URLs input. No validation error messages were displayed for invalid URLs, which is a failure in validation detection. However, the live preview did not update with invalid URLs, which is correct behavior. Overall, the system fails to notify users of invalid URLs but prevents live preview update with invalid data. Further fix is needed for validation error display.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/702c410c-1d6b-42ed-a3da-c5ce14f315b3/b240bc3c-29e3-4156-97af-ba5378c6c067
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Analysis / Findings:** While the system prevents live preview from updating with invalid URLs (correct behavior), it fails to display validation error messages to notify users of invalid or malformed URL inputs, resulting in poor user feedback and potentially confusing UX.

---

- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/702c410c-1d6b-42ed-a3da-c5ce14f315b3/02d2fa11-b0dc-420b-9352-25e9eed71e42
- **Status:** ❌ Failed

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC007
- **Test Name:** Live Preview - Real-Time Update Accuracy
- **Test Code:** [TC007_Live_Preview___Real_Time_Update_Accuracy.py](./TC007_Live_Preview___Real_Time_Update_Accuracy.py)
- **Test Error:** N/A
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/702c410c-1d6b-42ed-a3da-c5ce14f315b3/a7040f78-d282-407d-8570-95ae1a0ed13d
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** All changes to profile, social links, or custom links instantly and accurately reflect in the live preview without delays or errors. Real-time data binding and UI rendering work correctly.

### Requirement: URL-based Data Storage
- **Description:** Encodes all user data into the URL for persistence and enables data restoration after page refresh or URL sharing.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC008
- **Test Name:** URL-based Data Storage - Encode and Preserve Data
- **Test Code:** [TC008_URL_based_Data_Storage___Encode_and_Preserve_Data.py](./TC008_URL_based_Data_Storage___Encode_and_Preserve_Data.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify that all user data including profile information, social links, and custom links are correctly encoded into the URL and reloaded properly after page refresh or URL sharing is not fully successful. Despite filling all fields with valid data and clicking various buttons to trigger data serialization, the URL remained unchanged at the base 'http://localhost:3000/'. Reloading the page cleared all data, indicating no data persistence or encoding in the URL. Therefore, the application does not currently encode or restore user data via the URL as required by the task.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/702c410c-1d6b-42ed-a3da-c5ce14f315b3/057ed4ea-1f50-478f-a69a-dbc2f3bb24e9
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** The application does not encode user data (profile info, social links, custom links) into the URL, nor restore it on page refresh or sharing, leading to loss of data persistence and a poor user experience.

---

#### Test 2
- **Test ID:** TC009
- **Test Name:** URL-based Data Storage - Large Data Size and Edge Cases
- **Test Code:** [TC009_URL_based_Data_Storage___Large_Data_Size_and_Edge_Cases.py](./TC009_URL_based_Data_Storage___Large_Data_Size_and_Edge_Cases.py)
- **Test Error:** N/A
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/702c410c-1d6b-42ed-a3da-c5ce14f315b3/feb10221-9e76-4ff2-83c9-54331193157d
- **Status:** ✅ Passed
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Analysis / Findings:** System can handle large amounts of data encoded in the URL including special characters and maximum field lengths, without breaking functionality or UI.

---

### Requirement: Responsive Layout
- **Description:** Ensures the three-column layout adapts gracefully to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes without breaking usability or visual quality.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC010
- **Test Name:** Responsive Layout - Adaptation on Various Screen Sizes
- **Test Code:** [TC010_Responsive_Layout___Adaptation_on_Various_Screen_Sizes.py](./TC010_Responsive_Layout___Adaptation_on_Various_Screen_Sizes.py)
- **Test Error:** The three-column layout on the application was successfully verified on desktop resolution. The left input panel and right preview panel are visible, appropriately sized, and functional without overlap or visual issues. However, due to repeated attempts to resize the viewport and lack of confirmation on layout adaptation, the tablet and mobile screen size verifications were not completed. Therefore, the task is only partially finished.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/702c410c-1d6b-42ed-a3da-c5ce14f315b3/95f2dfcc-c7b4-4f15-b991-4a10ef486080
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Analysis / Findings:** Only desktop resolution was verified properly; tablet and mobile screen size adaptation was not confirmed, meaning responsive layout functionality is only partially validated.

#### Test 1
- **Test ID:** TC011
- **Test Name:** Demo Data Templates - Load and Apply Template Content
- **Test Code:** [TC011_Demo_Data_Templates___Load_and_Apply_Template_Content.py](./TC011_Demo_Data_Templates___Load_and_Apply_Template_Content.py)
- **Test Error:** N/A
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/702c410c-1d6b-42ed-a3da-c5ce14f315b3/1f9bd3e4-80ec-4b46-98a1-b45813bbd8b4
